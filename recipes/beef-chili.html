    <ol>

        <li>Pour remaining bone broth and chill beans into a high power blender, such as a Vitamix®. Cover with lid and blend on High power for 30 seconds. Pour blended mixture into the Instant Pot®, but do not stir.</li>
        <li>Close and lock the lid.  Select high pressure according to manufacturer’s instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer’s instructions, about 5 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer’s instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. </li>
